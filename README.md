# Park Assist — Smart Urban Parking System

## Overview
Park Assist is an AI-driven urban parking assistance system developed during the
**10th MAKE OHI/O Hackathon (Honda Challenge)**, where it earned **Second Place**.

The system detects available parking spaces in real time using ultrasonic sensors
and provides drivers with an intuitive interface to reduce parking search time
and urban congestion.

## Problem Statement
Urban environments face significant congestion and emissions due to drivers
circling in search of parking. Park Assist addresses this problem by enabling
real-time detection of vacant parking spots to improve efficiency and sustainability.

## System Architecture
- Ultrasonic sensors detect vehicle presence
- Microcontroller processes sensor data
- Backend logic determines parking availability
- User interface displays real-time parking status

---

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Arduino
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- Embedded Systems

---

## Key Contributions
- Designed and implemented sensor-based vacancy detection logic
- Integrated hardware inputs with backend decision logic
- Developed a driver-friendly interface for real-time updates
- Optimized detection accuracy for real-world urban conditions

---

## Project Context
Built as part of the **MAKE OHI/O Hackathon** in collaboration with a cross-functional team
to solve a real-world mobility challenge proposed by Honda.
